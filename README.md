# DisulphideBond-A-potent-feature-of-Protein-Classification
Bio-informatics Research Project.


Abstract. Proteins are the building blocks of any life-forms. Its efficient classification thereby, plays an important role in various researches. Till now, most researches have been concentrated on increasing the computational efficiency. Despite the variety of existing solutions, an effective solution hasnâ€™t been found yet. Classification techniques using disulphide bond has had quite a popularity in the past but unfortunately, they failed to register the required efficiency as none of the models considered the possibility of using a combination of the distance values of all the three types of disulphide bond. 

The proposed methodology uses a combination of the parallel, alternate and quad-core disulphide bond to produce a more efficient feature extraction technique that not only classifies better than the existing disulphide methodologies but also produces an effectively reduced dataset, whenever it fails in perfect classification.
